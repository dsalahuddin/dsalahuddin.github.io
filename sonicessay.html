								<h2>Transcript</h2>
								<p>[00:01]<br>When I was ten years old, I discovered the thrill of typing on a keyboard. At that age, I wouldn’t dare part with my hand-written journals, but the clunky keystrokes of the early 2000s and the seemingly limitless Word document inspired me to write like nothing had ever before. But as I was rapidly increasing my wpm and writing the next great novel (the way only a fourth grader knew how), I had yet to leave the confines of Microsoft Word. Although I had found solace in my hand-me-down computer, the digital sphere still seemed daunting and unwelcome.</p>
								<p>[00:49]<br>It was a casual conversation with a classmate that eventually led me to Wattpad. It was not only my first encounter with online writing but also my first real dalliance with the internet, outside of school projects. I thought, if dialing up meant tripling my reading list, the internet would do just fine. My bookshelf, teeming with paperbacks I had read and reread and worn to the bone, sighed with relief that day. I spent hours scrolling through and commenting on stories, leaving reviews and suggesting edits. And as I read, I also wrote.</p>
								<p>[01:33]<br>In 2012, I found Tumblr. As I navigated its deep blue waters and tried to mold my blog into a somewhat coherent setup, I understood what made digital spaces tick (though I didn’t yet have the word for it): multimodality. I enjoyed the multiplicity I found on my dashboard; text posts and images, audio and video, and everything meshed together was unpredictable and exciting. And even though I had always been uncomfortable with code, even I enjoyed messing around with HTML and customizing my Tumblr page every other month. The digital world was no longer daunting; it was dynamic.</p>
								<p>[02:24]<br>A year later, I came back to user-generated writing, this time on FanFiction and FictionPress. What had changed since my days on Wattpad was my access to social media. I had found a community on Tumblr of writers and artists and geeks, whose creativity was infectious. They would link their stories and poetry to their blogs, accompanied by original illustrations and photos, or a maybe song that complemented them. I started doing the same—or tried to. Through Tumblr, I also developed a love of spoken word poetry, which soon prompted me to film in front of a camera.</p>
								<p>[03:12]<br><b>[Excerpt from video recording]</b><br>“…are now 18<br>A planet of greatness shoring up inside of you<br>waiting to spin on its axis with your unblemished hands<br>Your eyes will tell stories about the universe<br>You are more than you realize.</p>

									<p>You’ll consume the world with your roaring thoughts that speak millennia before us<br>Your heartbeat racing to greatness at the speed of light<br>You are not the girl who got lucky<br>You are the girl who made it happen<br>The odds fail at the sight of you,<br>Because only you can claim you…”</p>
								<p>[03:50]<br>If that soundbite was any indication, I had little to work with. It’s true, tinkering around with iMovie basics was nothing spectacular but editing my own video and uploading it on YouTube felt like an accomplishment.</p>
								<p>[04:09]<br>Though I have often dismissed my digital footprint as unremarkable in the past, I have gained newfound appreciation for it, thanks largely to my digital writing courses in university. Gone are the days of putting pen to paper and calling it a day. In Writing for Digital Cultures, I was glad to be familiar with the blogging environment when I created my WordPress blog “Fight Song,” and my amateur skills with video-editing software came in handy when I published a short film titled “One and the Same.” When it comes to my digital authoring practices, I often still feel like a fish out of water, but, boy, is it thrilling to exist in these digital spaces.</p>
